This bookdown project shows my work for the main master's seminar from my *M.Sc. Mathematics in Data Science* at the TUM. The topic of the seminar is *Statistical Methods and Models*. My topic and thus covered in this project are **boosting methods.** First I will guide the reader through some theory about (tree-based gradient) boosting and the famous and very efficient implementation of such a tree-based gradient boosting model XGBoost. Then I will illustrate the discussed model with two real world data sets in a regression setting.

Furthermore the project contains slide decks that summarize conducted analysis and present the work.
