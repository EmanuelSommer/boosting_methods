This bookdown project shows my work for the main master's seminar from my M. Sc. Mathematics in Data Science at the TUM. The topic of the seminar is *Statistical Methods and Models*. My topic and the thus covered in this project are **boosting methods.** First I will guide the reader through some theory about boosting and then will illustrate the discussed models with a real world application in an regression setting.

Furthermore the project contains slide decks that summarize conducted analysis and present the work.
